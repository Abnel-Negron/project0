# üëãHi everyone this is the Record Book project
 This project is to show my progress of the knowledge of Python with the integration of using MongoDB via Pymongo using CLI. My program asks the user if they want to add, remove, update and search in the record book or CRUD operations(create, read, update, delete). Then storing that user data in to MongoDB into 2 tables to show the relationship between Pymongo and MongoDB.

# Technologies Used üë®‚Äçüíª
- Used Create, Read, Update, Delete operations. 
- Inputs and stores user data into MongoDB in a readable format.
- Used PyMongo to incorporate database relationships.
- Created a Command Line Interface(CLI) to show how the program works when ran.
- Produced a Git Repository for storage and viewing purposes.
- Presented my program to my fellow batch-mates and instructors.
- Practiced Normalization in my program.
- The purpose of the program is to show user data can be stored and can be viewed at any time since humans can't remember everything.
